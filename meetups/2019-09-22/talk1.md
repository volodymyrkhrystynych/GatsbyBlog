# AI methodology and new programs at Guelph
www.gwtaylor.net @ Guelph university

In recent years ai has been tasked with solving specific problems and Guelph has introduced an ai methodology responsibility and applications program.

On methodology ai doesn't know what it doesn't know

A properly calibrated neural network would have a even layout of error, but current neural networks are not like thats, they have uneven

They created a network that can ask for hints based on confidence, due to being penalized for asking to often it creates a much more accurate confidence score.

While batch normalization is standard it reduces model robustness. They did tests and batch normalizations gives a small increase result on clean networks the accuracy with noise was much lower.

Where image data comes from really influences what i can recognize, a bar of soap in rural India looks different than a bar of soap in Canada.

They created a ml insect trap with a sticky trap that used ml to identify any pests that would harm the plantation.
Another project was focused on ecological observation, pop estimates, diversity and other such data.
