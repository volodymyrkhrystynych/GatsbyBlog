Define the problem you want to solve, then you can try to see if AI is the right tool

Diversity is necessary!

Diversity in:
 - degrees
 - world views
 - data


Organizational culture is critical
start small and scale

Around 70% of AI project fail
 - mostly due to the people
	 - push back
	 - lack of belief
	 - concern about jobs
 - Unrealistic expectations of the tech
 - leveraging more unstructured data
 - Biased data
 - Regulatory agencies
	 - would be much more confortable with explainable ml
	 - regulation is immature and once it does then you will need to adjust
 - Responsible/Ethical AI
	 - TD responsible AI forum :investigate:
	 - Human oversight
 - Facial recognition ban - SF, Oakland, Brussels/EU vs China's position
 - Deepfakes
 - Explainability


There is an explosion in the AI community

Canada is one of the top in AI research, AI training but very low in AI implementation


Q&A

Tesla is currently trying to get permission to get the Canadian gov to allow self driving cars:
