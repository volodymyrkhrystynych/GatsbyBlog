A lady showing how using an addon to a cellphone lets her see the difference between different olive oils and how such a thing would be able to tell between counterfeits or to identify what something is. It can even tell if an authentic product is diluted, like cornstarch added to cosmetics or cola added to whiskey. It can even tell if clothing is mulan wool or just something labelled that.

Can tell what kind of wood a certain plank is. Or if leather is authentic or not.

Their verifier has a 1 micron resolution.

Can tell what kind of bacteria is in a sample by the way it swims.

:thought:
A really cool thing, it would be interesting to see what constitutes counterfeit, ie low quality leather and high quality leather and how it will keep the natural variance in production from having you say that something is a counterfeit when it is not.

Knowledge is not as important as the ability to combine different things

The inseption of this project was when she was working with a diamond company on a blockchain project and they were more interested in the prospect of counterfeit identification and since she worked near the physics people and the biology people at IBM she was able to get insight and find the path towards combining all those pieces into the verifier
