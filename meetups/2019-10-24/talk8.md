Make sure that you have two different phones and keep them separate

Money laundering is moving to cryptocurrencies

APT - advance persistant threats

APTs in the world
 - US : top APT in the world
 - North korea
 - China
 - Russia
 - most other countries probably

An APT from North Korea initiated a hack that almost got 1 billion from a secure bank and the only reason it failed was due to a typo

An entity called the Shadow Brokers stole zero day exploits and started to auction them off.

The Equation group is an API that is probably run by the US and Isreal

If you ever go to defcon never bring your laptop or phone as you will probably get hacked

Never pick up a lost usb key

Air gapped facilities are not perfectly secure, just one usb can cause the same thing as the Tuxnet hack of the Iran nuclear program
