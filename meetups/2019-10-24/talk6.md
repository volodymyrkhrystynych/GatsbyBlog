# AI fro cybersecurity Can be a marketing advantage

Companies that have cybersecurity capabilities often do not advertise cybersecurity due to:
 - not wanting to remind their consumer that there is a risk
 - Do not want to put a target on their back
 - do not think it is worth it


Current generation will shift providers for information security even if the more secure provider is more expensive

Many businesses reduce security to reduce price instead of increasing security to increase value

Current business goals should combine cybersecurity into the business goal instead of a means of decreasing liability.
