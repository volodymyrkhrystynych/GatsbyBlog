We are in the end stage of this economic cycle, 

Democracy needs a vibrant economy, all the countries that have rising populist factions are those whose governments failed to deliver the wealth, and the wealth failed to deliver the democracy.

As we complicate our technology we increase our threat surface

The current world economy is a combination of competition between companies and state owned companies. 

Of every 100 cyber crimes only 1 is brought to justice in the US

Some countries even promote cybercrime as it increases jobs and they may use state employed criminals or through proxies.

All threats are global and the effects are local

The discussion on privacy is an incredibly good thing as it pushes for a better future

Complacency will kill you in cybersecurity.
