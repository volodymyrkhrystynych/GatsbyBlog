# AI and Cognitive Services in Power Bi
## Ashraf Ghonaim

Microsoft has pre-trained models that seem to be in house so they should have different fallibilities and strengths than the Google or Facebook ones

Machine learning specialists should be able to properly measure the margin of error.

You can build a model in PowerBI using python or R which means that you can use Tensorflow and everything else in that

Microsoft PowerBI has:
 - Language detection
 - Key Phrase Extraction
 - Sentiment Analysis
 - Image Tagging

It seems to be a smaller selection than what IBM offers, probably because IBM placed more resources in building out their capabilities as a software company and seem to be trying to corner the market for Auto ML and other such things while Microsoft is more spread out and less agile.

PowerBI looks a lot like Microsoft excel, probably on purpose, it has a lot of drag and drop and the graphing features look just like the ones in excel where you drag columns and whatnot

Looks quite cool, he showed sentiment analysis and with a pie chart that showed the percentage positive, moderate and negative he could filter a separate table with a list of the comments by which slice of the pie he selected

Key phase extraction shows a view inner join between the comment, the sentiment list and a many to many table between the two.

In all PowerBI seems to have quite a few nice visualizations that would work for non ai people, like a word cloud for the sentiment analysis, the ease at which you can create nice looking visualization is probably something Microsoft focused on as they seem to be marketing it toward management people and everyone who is intimidated by the black box that is normal ML programming and expertise
