Data Exploration Outcomes
 - Asses data quality
 - Select key features that might be relevant for modelling
 - Understand metadata or relationships between features and their values
	- If you are predicting housing prices, if you select square footage and number of bathrooms as important features you might find that they correlate so much that having number of bathrooms is redundant

When doing AutoML you need to do all the feature engineering, selection and data cleaning before.

It helps pick a good model once you have that and should be a best practice since it is a simple step.

AutoML does not deal with overfitting, you need to have a validation set to check if it gives you an overfit model and then you need to change the data you give it to make it more evenly spread/better so that it outputs a better model.
