Cyber security specialists get a lot of false positives

enterprise security:
Sensors > Data lake > SIEM tool > [orchastration](orchastration) > API > Controls

Impact
Security solution : 75 avg
96% alerts not investigated

Threat vectors are increasing
Deployment of more sensors with AI
Contextual knowledge

Trying to enable cyber security professionals to use AI tools

Problems specific to cybersecurity
Imbalanced dataset 0.001%
Dynamic env
Attack pattern not necessarily carried forward (hackers are
getting increasingly targeted)

Generic solutions do not have context necessary, the attack
surfaces are different and the data quality is terrible

Cybersecurity + Ai specialists are super rare

Hackers are adaptive and the instant a vuln is patched hackers
will go for the next easiest vector

## Attack vectors

Data poisoning : using data poisoning to change the AI decision
boudery you can then launch a sofisticated attack that avoids
detection

Introduction noise can cause ai to missclassify, another attack
vector

Expose model attributes

High error rate can have very high cost as a high throughput and
high false positives can cause the security specialists to turn
on bypass and ignore legit breaches.
