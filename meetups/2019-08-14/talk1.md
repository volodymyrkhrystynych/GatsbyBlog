# Security Implications of Quantum Computing for Enterprises

RSA is going to break

private and hash function are twice as easy on quantum
computers, ie a 256 classical one is a 128 on a quantum computer

Investing crypto agility

The reason many companies are still on RSA when ess is much more
efficient is because of lack of crypto agility, any change, even
an increase in key size is a massive money pit for the
companies.

There is a competition currently in progress about what kind of
quantum resistant security algorithm will be the standard in the
future. It started in 2015, and will end in 2024
