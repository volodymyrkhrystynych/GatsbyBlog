# Nudge and understanding human relations

Nudge's company product is helping sales figure out what their relationship with the client is, this would need the application to be able to read emails and process the information in them. One thing that they needed to find out is finding how they can identify which emails were from a person and which were list newsletters or the like.

A good idea when building an application that employs ml is to start small.

From what I understand Nudge seems to have closed down due to not enough sales.

Questions:
Why did it fail?

 - She things if nudge was part of something bigger than it may have succeeded, they tried to have their application import information into an application that was used by sales.
