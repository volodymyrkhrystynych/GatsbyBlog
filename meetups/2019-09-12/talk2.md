moving from excel and alteryx to databrinks and datarobot for data storage and manipulation and data iku for model development

data processing was a big hurdle

they are currently using automl in datarobot and data iku

in the future they want to get more datasources and more advanced ml algorithms using spark ml

FUTURE:
from the data sources of weather transactions demographics and mobile interactions
 
to offer creation from databricks, spark ml and offer use cases

to offer deployment of mobile text or email
