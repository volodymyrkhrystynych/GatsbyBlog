Talking about mendel

Siamese neural network
/probably to input both sides of the gene

Predicting gene expression, very expensive normally. Trying to
use a dna sequence and outputing a Chip-seq value. 

_There are a lot of open source genomic databases!!!!_

Knowlege of genetic bugs and fixing them with CRIPSR.

CNNs vs Evolution driving ai
CNNs better when consistency needed
