# Building Privacy protected datasets with quantifiable privacy risk
##Monica Holboke (CEO/Founder @ CryptoNumerics)

Found out that no one built a solution to training a model on datasets that vendors do not want to share
Went into academia and found that there are solutions

They built a model that automatically finds all the identifiable information, they did something so that once this step is done that all the  useful information in the dataset is not lost

They also created a system to allow collaboration, allowing for calculations on datasets without exposing the datasets

Improving privacy on indirect identifiers you can supress some information, turning age of 52 to a range 50-55 or blurring out the last 2 numbers of an area code.
