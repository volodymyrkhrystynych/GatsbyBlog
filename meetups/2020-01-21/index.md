# Machine learning workshop

14 people showed up in the end, though 1 or two left early

She is going over the same overview as before, Jupyter notebook intro

Euclidain distance is the normal one, ie a straight line length between two points

Python arrays concat when added ie: [1,2] + [3,4] = [1,2,3,4]

Pandas.dataframe.join joins dataframes on columns, in order to do this you need to specify the id by df.set_index('col_name')

Azure has a detection api azure_df.groupby('Language')['message'].count()

really useful graphing things:

%matplotlib inline
df.groupby('Class').count().plot(kind='bar')

if you add a ; to the end of the last call it silences the generic text that comes out with all graphs

more research: azure ml studio
