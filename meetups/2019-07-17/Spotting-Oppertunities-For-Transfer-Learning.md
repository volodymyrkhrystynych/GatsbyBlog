#Spotting the opportunity for transfer learning
##Azin Asgarian


##Transfer learning
 - humans are really good at it
 - machine learning community has focused on transfer learning
 - leverage similar models to a novel task

Domain
1. a fewture space : X
2. a marginal space

Task
1. a label space : y
2. a predictive fuction(learned)

Between two different domains there is a marginal distribution
difference.

Questions you should answer.
1. what to transfer
2. how to transfer
3. when to transfer

If there isn't a lot of similarity between you domains you can
get negative transfer which makes it harder for your model.

Transfer learning approaches
1. [Instance based approaches](Instance-based-approaches)
2. [feature based approeaches](feature-based-approeaches)
	- assy,etric feature transformation
	-  symmetric ....
3. Parameter-based-approches
4. hybrid-base-approaches (instance and parameter)
5. relational-based-approaches

Transfer learning approches
heterogeneous transfer learning
medium risk, high reward
homogeneous ...
high risk, very high reward

pick the right class of method for your problem.

Review: Interestiong, a lot of things mentioned but felt like a
had heard and understand most of it already. Though the specific
words used to further my progress is good.
