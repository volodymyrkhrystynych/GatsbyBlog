This is a general intro to data science.
Domain expertise is mainly understanding what each bit of data means then understanding if the output is correct and in what way it is wrong

Data science process:
 - Business understanding
 - Data understanding
 - Data preperation
 - Modeling
 - Evaluation
 - Deployment

Domain expertise is also important to remove dupicate columns with different names, like if you have temp, temp_normalized and other types of transformations you need to remove columns until you only have 1 temp column so that temp doesn't have a disproportionate affect on your model

Corellated columns have a relationship and are not independant

docs.microsoft.com is a great resource for tutorials and is a github repo
