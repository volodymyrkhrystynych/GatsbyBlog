##Data science based product recommendation

Real time prediction that is calibrated on the fly as customers
are going through the purchase process. Collect information from
3rd parties, call recordings, observed session data (browser,
returning viewer etc)

Constant ab testing for the questions that are asked to the
customer. A desire to decrease the parameter space to the most
useful information for prediction.

through the website. What do they want, what products are they
eligible for. 

For insurance, due to it's high government oversight, must be
explainable. 

They have deployed 60+ models. Using micro models they have
flexibility and explainability. 

Model design
 - define the problem
 - define available data
 - design : rather 10 simple explainable models than 1 hard
   model
 - [Implementation](./Implementation) : how are you going to use it in production,
   is it fast enough to not interrupt the user journey?
 - [Evaluate](./Evaluate)
